miniSpartan6+ Projects
======================

I have just got a miniSpartan6+ FPGA development board, and I'm learning to use it.
This is going to be where I put the files I play with. There's some C stuff, which
uses standard make files, and the VHDL stuff, which uses hdlmake to generate makefiles,
and also relies on Xilinx ISE being installed. I'm doing all this stuff in Linux.

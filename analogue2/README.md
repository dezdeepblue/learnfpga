This project reads from AIN7 and displays the value on the LEDs, in bargraph form.

It improves on analogue in that there is now an ADC component, and it uses
shift registers.

However, this version seems to be reading from the wrong pins sometimes,
although when I connect it up to a logic analyser I can't work out why.
No doubt I'm doing something silly, due to not knowing what I'm doing.
